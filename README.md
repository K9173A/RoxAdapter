## What is Safrosoft RoX?
RoX is a [freeware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware) game, created by Safrosoft (Ilya and Dmitry Safro) in 2002. The game inherited its concept from [Boulder Dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder_Dash) and [Pac Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man), but also improved gameplay by adding big variety of different items, enemies and nice music. The goal of the game is to pass to the final level of the standard level collection (69 levels). Player uses Thrasher (creature which looks like PacMan) to collect unids (atoms). As soon as all unids are eaten, an exit portal opens and you can complete a level.
